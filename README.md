SolO orbit data plots
=====================

This repository contains scripts to create the Solar Orbiter orbit data plots, prepared by
Johan von Forstner and Alexander Kollhoff.

The plotting style was inspired by a plot from [McComas et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1811-1)
(Figure 1) for Parker Solar Probe ISêçàIS.

Plots can be produced in a plain matplotlib style (`'plain'`) or in a style that emulates the ESA press release version
of this plot (`'esa'`). For the latter, the `NotesEsa` font needs to be installed, which can be found in the `fonts`
directory.
